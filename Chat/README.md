This is a couple of lessons from https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/3-intro-to-langchain/3-chat-models/
<p>chat.py is the most basic program</p>
<p>chain_chat I added a chain, which allows more complex systems</p>
<p>context_chain_chat I added a context, which grounds the llm response</p>
<p>history_chat adds memory to the chat</p>
<p>history_neo4j_chat adds memory to the chat with neo4j database</p>
<p>agent calls necessary tools when needed</p>
